# C-project
This is my first game written in c ++. It was written for a programming class project
The game I created is an application modeled on the popular game "Icy Tower".

The player's goal is to score as many points as possible, which are written on a one-way list and print the highest score after falling / losing the game.

The game was based on the popular anime series "Naruto". At the beginning, in the main menu, you could start the appropriate version of the difficulty (easy, normal and hard) by selecting the appropriate character.
